MongoDB is a famous representative of NoSQL databases. It is a document-oriented database, which means that data will be stored in documents. “Database – Collections – Documents – Fields” is the data structure of MongoDB. Records are called as “Documents” in MongoDB and they are in JSON format. Documents are kept as “Collections”. Every collection should have a unique primary key as “_id”.
